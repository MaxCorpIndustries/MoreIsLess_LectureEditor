### Description
This software was meant to make the lecture videos from professors a lot easier to learn from if the instructor likes to wait or perhaps talks a bit too slow or too fast.
This is done by detecting the 'quiet points in the lecture (sections of the video which fall below a user controlled decibel level and removes it from the final processed lecture.
It has been capable of reducing class lectures down from **1 hr 15 minutes** down to **23 minutes** with 0% information loss! 

### Disclaimer

*For professors:
No malice is intended, this software is purely
to enhance the content from the instructor
for students who prefer different learning styles.*


*For students:
This software is not magic, it cannot help if you
simply do not understand the content.
Asking a teacher for help is always the best way to
understand the topic.*
