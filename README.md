# MoreIsLess_LectureEditor
 
made by: Maximo Perasso

This software was meant to make the lecture videos from professors a lot easier to learn from if the instructor likes to wait or perhaps talks a bit too slow or too fast.

DISCLAIMER (for professors):
No malice is intended, this software is purely
to enhance the content from the instructor
for students who prefer different learning styles.

DISCLAIMER (for students):
This software is not magic, it cannot help if you
simply do not understand the content.
Asking a teacher for help is always the best way to
understand the topic.
